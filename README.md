Assignment 5: AI

Assignment Overview
You are to create a mixed reality VR experience that focuses on AI driven non-player character (NPC) interaction.  You will devise an original scenario based a specific theme.
You will implement NPC’s that can be interacted with via a dialogue system. The dialogue system should be able to give a range of different choices to the user and lead to different outcomes in a coherent storyline.
The NPCs should display standard AI behaviours such as pathfinding, group behaviour, emotional display etc. Ideally these behaviours should be implemented using standard AI techniques such as behaviour trees, finite state machines etc.
Interactivity with the NPCs and the wider environment of your chosen environment will be key.  You will also need to write a short-written report on the use of AI driven NPCs within the XR industry, along with video showcasing the functionality of your app.  
Create Virtual Reality application for Stand Alone which has the mechanics of:
•	Dialogue tree
•	Crowd simulation
•	A creative story to fit those mechanics.
